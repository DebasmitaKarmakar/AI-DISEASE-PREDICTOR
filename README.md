# ü´Ä Heart Disease Predictor  
An AI-powered ML project for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters.  
This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning including **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit**.

## üìå Dataset Overview  

We used the **UCI Heart Disease dataset** with patient health records.  
The dataset contains **13 clinical features** that are transformed into **30 model-ready features** using preprocessing and one-hot encoding.
